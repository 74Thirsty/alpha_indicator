AlphaEdge (Alpha Indicator)
Modular, AI-Assisted Trading Research Engine

â¸»

ðŸš€ Key Selling Features
	1.	End-to-End Signal Generation
	â€¢	Feature Extraction: Instantly compute over a dozen technical indicators (RSI, EMA, MACD, OBV, Bollinger Bands) via Finta.
	â€¢	AI-Driven Models: Train XGBoost (or other) models to predict price moves, classify trade setups, and rank arbitrage paths.
	â€¢	Backtesting Suite: Simulate your strategies (entry/exit, stop-loss, take-profit) over historical OHLCV with full PnL statistics.
	2.	Seamless Integration
	â€¢	Modular Engine: Drop the alphaedge package into your existing workflow or custom GPT agent for on-the-fly signal computation.
	â€¢	Arbitrage Signal Ranking: Feed your DeFi arbitrage paths through the trained model to prioritize the most profitable cycles.
	3.	Optional GUI Dashboard
	â€¢	Streamlit / Dash Interface: Visualize live or historical indicator charts, equity curves, and model predictions without coding.
	â€¢	One-Click CSV Import: Load data from yfinance or local files and get interactive charts in seconds.
	4.	Real-Time Alerts & Notifications
	â€¢	Telegram & Discord Hooks: Configure triggers for strategy conditions or high-probability model signalsâ€”stay informed anywhere.
	â€¢	Custom Alert Rules: Define thresholds on any indicator or model output for precise notifications.
	5.	GPT-Ready Blueprint
	â€¢	Clean Class/Function Map: Easily generate or extend code via Copilot/GPTâ€”classes include FeatureEngine, StrategyRunner, AlphaModel, SignalBook, and OHLCVLoader.
	â€¢	Automated Documentation: In-code diagrams and a clear README layout make onboarding new team members a breeze.
